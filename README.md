🎯 #Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering



📌 Overview
Customer segmentation is a powerful technique in marketing and business strategy, where customers are grouped based on similarities in their characteristics or behavior. This project applies K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to automatically segment customers using features like income and spending score.

These insights help businesses personalize marketing, enhance customer experience, and increase profitability.

🌍 Real-World Applications
🛒 Retail & E-commerce – Personalized promotions based on customer behavior

💳 Banking & Finance – Targeted financial products for different income groups

🧳 Travel & Hospitality – Bundling offers for frequent travelers vs. occasional users

📱 Telecom – Customer retention strategies and loyalty programs

🏥 Healthcare – Grouping patients by treatment needs and lifestyle factors

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Scikit-learn – K-Means algorithm, preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

📁 Dataset
Example features used for segmentation:

CustomerID

Age

Gender

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

You can replace this with real-world customer datasets (e.g., e-commerce or CRM data).
